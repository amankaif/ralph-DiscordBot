# ralph-DiscordBot
## Description:
This is a discord bot I made that does not really serve a unique purpose other than helping me learn the various functionalities available in the discord py library, like:
1. Reading in messages.
2. Responding differently with context to which user has sent the message.
3. Different interactive commands and functions.
3. Play media in voice channels.

## What can it do:
As of now
- Toss a coin (an arbitrary way of settling a dispute in the server which is why it can also roll a dice)
- Roll a die (command is knowingly incorrectly labeled dice since telling a bot to die didn't feel intuitive)
- Add two numbers together (Test feature, will be deprecated)
- Join or leave specified voice channel
- Join a vc to play the "less go" snippet from the song VIBEZ by DaBaby purely for comedic effect.

## Future Prospects:

- Ping the bot to set a trigger for it to ping you when a certain amount of or certain people gather in the voice channels.
  - One of my internet friends who wasn't online too much kept missing out on our discord conversations because we also kept forgetting to tag him. This bot was born to
  originally solve this problem and this is still in the works as I left this unfinished to begin yet another project.
